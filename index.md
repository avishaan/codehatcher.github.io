I love salsa dancing almost as much as I love solving difficult problems. I'm an engineer focused on innovation without losing sight of the
needs of the customer.
Having worked as both a NASA engineer and as the CTO of a health-tech
startup, I learned an important product engineering lesson:
> a product without a customer is indistinguishable from art; it may look *beautiful*, but it can't solve your customer's problem

Leading engineering teams to solve business problems is **my passion**. Nothing
is as fulfilling as getting a team of engineers to work with a team of designers to create an innovative product loved by customers.

If you're curious to see what **motivates me** as an engineer who likes to program, check out my [posts on machine learning]({% link _pages/category-archive.md %}). If you're feeling studious and want to see what motivates me as a team leader, check
out my [book notes]({% link _pages/books.md %}) on what I've read. If you're looking for ideas, see what I've worked on for past projects (coming soon).

## Add notes here, won't be rendered
- engineer that values product and customer
  - engineer who feels
- innovation without customer is art
- NASA, CTO
- excerpt from book "if you want to learn more about my life and other well
  known entreprenuers, check out such and such book"
If you are curious about what makes me tick, my posts on machine learning or my
reviews of books are probably a couple good places to start.
