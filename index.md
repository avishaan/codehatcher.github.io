I love salsa dancing almost as much as I love solving technical problems. I'm an engineer focused on innovation without losing sight of the
customer.
Having worked as both a NASA engineer and as the CTO of a health-tech
startup, I learned an important product engineering lesson. 
> a product without a customer is indistinguishable from art; it may look *beautiful*, but it can't solve a problem

Leading engineering teams to solve business problems is **my passion**. Nothing
is as fulfilling as getting a team of engineers to work with a team of designers to create an innovative product loved by the customers.

If you're curious to see what **motivates me** as an engineer who likes to program, check out my [posts on machine learning]({% link _pages/category-archive.md %}). If you're curious to see what motivates me as a team leader, check
out my [book notes]({% link _pages/books.md %}) on what I've read. If you're curious to see what I've worked on in the past so we can collaborate, check out some of my past projects.

Feel free to reach out. **I'm open to** advising, investing, collaborating, and other interesting opportunities.

## Add notes here, won't be rendered
- engineer that values product and customer
  - engineer who feels
- innovation without customer is art
- NASA, CTO
- excerpt from book "if you want to learn more about my life and other well
  known entreprenuers, check out such and such book"
If you are curious about what makes me tick, my posts on machine learning or my
reviews of books are probably a couple good places to start.
