If you want to colab on a new machine learning framework or talk about something I missed in my book summaries on cognitive biases, let's connect!

If you want together on a quick call, feel free to grab a spot on my calendar below. 
If none of those times work (thinking of you my London friends), <a href="https://mailhide.io/e/V7WAu" onclick="mailhidepopup=window.open('https://mailhide.io/e/V7WAu','mailhidepopup','width=580,height=635'); return false;">send me an email</a> and we can coordinate *old school*.
