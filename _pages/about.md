I'm an engineer focused on innovation without losing sight of the
customer.
Whether it was as an engineer for N.A.S.A. or as the CTO of a health-tech
startup, I learned *innovation without a customer is art*. 

Leading engineering teams to solve business problems is **my passion**. Nothing
is as fulfilling as leading an engineering team to develop an innovative product
and into a cutting edge team.

If you're curious to see what **motivates me** as an engineer who likes to program, check out my posts on
machine learning [posts on machine learning]({% link _pages/category-archive.md %}). If you're curious to see what motivates me as a team leader, check
out my [book notes]({% link _pages/books.md %}) on what I've read. If you're curious to see what I've worked on in the past so we can collaborate, check out some of my past projects.

Feel free to reach out. **I'm open to** advising, investing, collaborating, and other potential opportunities.

## Add notes here, won't be rendered
- engineer that values product and customer
  - engineer who feels
- innovation without customer is art
- NASA, CTO
- excerpt from book "if you want to learn more about my life and other well
  known entreprenuers, check out such and such book"
If you are curious about what makes me tick, my posts on machine learning or my
reviews of books are probably a couple good places to start.
