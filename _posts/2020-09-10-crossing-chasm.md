# Intro
As always, I don't agree with or use everything I read, but I will still try and
summarize it here. {% include book-para.md %}

This book is so concise, I loved it. Even though it is relatively concise
it's a pretty dense and informative read. As an engineer, having a product book
that looks at the marketing and selling aspects of a product was extremely
valuable. In some ways, this books feels like the complement to one of my
favorite books, [The Pragmatic Programmer]({% post_url
2020-09-06-pragmatic-programmer %}). I recommend all engineer founders to read
this. Also, if you are an engineering lead, this is a good book for you
to be able to understand why product and business do *some* of the things they
do. That can give insight into how to make your engineering team serve the end
customers better.

> Visionaries are that rare breed of people who have the insight to match up an emerging technology to a strategic opportunity, the temperament to translate that insight into a high-visibility, high-risk project, and the charisma to get the rest of their organization to buy into that project.

# Summary
In short, this is a book that talks about the gaps between technology businesses
and markets. It's a guide on how to bring technological-based products to market.

## Transitions
The transition from early adopters to mainstream is very important. Most assume
that transition will happen quietly. The plan needs to address the difference
between a few motivated early users and broader late users.

Most users are late adopters. New technology is not only *disruptive* to a
market but also inconveniently disruptive to a user's workflow. When developing
a new product, I like to pay a lot of attention to the current workflow of a
user. All things equal, I minimize disruptions to the user's workflow especially
at the beginning of their process.

## Markets
Aka consumer audiences

Other products that also started with specific niche markets and then proceeded
to conquer bigger markets include Oracle, IBM, and Google. The hedgehog section
[Good to Great]({% post_url 2020-09-08-good-to-great %}#hedgehog) related to
this idea of starting with a niche product and expanding out. In *Crossing the
Chasm* he applies it from the perspective of the audience.


### Innovative
The smallest segment that encourages others to investigate the product. The active
and aggressively pursue new technology because it's a central part of their
lives. Appealing to this segment is the first step. Many early adopters look to
these innovators.

### Early Adopters
Instead of the technology being a central part of their lives, this group is
drawn to the benefits of the technology. They rely on intuition and vision.
These are the "visionaries" looking to find more efficient ways to perform their
JTBD.

### Early Majority
They don't care about fads, so they will wait. This group wants to see well-established references before investing any substantial time and effort into a
product. This segment is large and appealing to this segment requires a
fundamental shift in marketing tactics. Practicality above all else.

### Late Majority
This group wants to see that all bugs have been fixed and want to be able to ask
someone for help when they need it. FAQs are likely not good enough for this
group. This group is not comfortable in their skills when dealing with a
technological product.

### Laggards
Generally not interested in technology. This is the group that is probably still
would prefer to use a taxi instead of uber for all use cases.

## Crossing
The chasm needs to be crossed at some point. One strategy is to incentivize your
early adopters to target the early majority. I'm not sure what kind of specific
advice this book really gives to deal with this, but at least be aware that the
strategy to cross this abyss will require a different marketing strategy. The
author suggests the market strategy is more important here. From a product
perspective, this means the *new* customer segment you are building and
validating for is the early majority. See [The Lean Startup]({% post_url
2020-09-10-lean-startup %}#pivot) for ways to pivot the product to
appeal to this new group of users.

Keep in mind it's not just the technology that may have to expand but all the experiences around the product itself. One very specific example of this
given by the author is how the late majority would likely want to ask someone
for help when they need it. This is not a direct application feature but still your
"product" as a whole.

## Launching
When launching the product, delays are your enemy. You won't have statistically
significant data so you'll need to use something that's a hybrid of intuition
and information. The author calls that informed-intuition.

Do not only focus on the implemented technology or the product but on how the
industry will change as a result of the innovation.

## Price
These changes are based on each segment. Visionaries tend not to be very sensitive to
price; if they need the feature they will pay for it. Consumers who buy later in
the product cycle will be price-sensitive but will still pay 30% more for a
product from a marketing leader. If you aren't the market leader, compete on
price by selling for 30% less.

## Crossed
It's not over when you have crossed the chasm into the next market segment.
Internal changes may need to happen to change the culture. Product changes will
need to occur as driven by the new segment. 

# Outro
This is a must-read for every startup entrepreneur. But it's not just for
cofounders, it's for anyone who has a technology product looking to expand into broader
customer segments. Or as the author might put it, the "next customer segment".
I've already set a reminder to re-read this book in 1 year, I'm hoping there is
even a new edition by then ðŸ¤ž.
